Today is my birthday. 
I live in Dnipro. 
I am 47-years woman that wants to change owm way.
Now I am an accounter, but I don't want to be as one.
Last week i have been in Gorgany. Once an year i ussually go to mountains with a backpack.
So I missed the start of this course that i had waited very much.
I have many plans on this year: to help my contry to win this war , to learn JS, to up my English level.
Now I try to do all home works in time. 
Want to say the Github is a bit hard for me. I am confused in functions)))
